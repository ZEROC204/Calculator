# Calculator
This is a simple calculator program written in python that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The user is prompted to choose an option from a menu, and then they are asked to input two numbers. The program then performs the chosen operation on the two numbers and displays the result.

The user is then asked if they want to continue, and if they choose yes, they are taken back to the menu. If they choose no, the program exits.
